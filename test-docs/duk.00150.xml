                <note type="project" target="#dat1">This manuscript appears to be a draft piece of journalism, although it is not known if it was ever published. While Whitman wrote journalistic pieces throughout his life, the handwriting, ink, and paper are most consistent with manuscripts known to have been written before the first appearance of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> in 1855. Edward Grier details some of the reasons for believing the manuscript to date to between 1841 and 1862 in <hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> (New York: New York University Press, 1984), 1:88.</note>

                day when we accompanied a <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear">newly arrived</add> Swiss gentleman, who had resided some time in England, to dine at one of the <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear"><handShift new="#h2"/>New York</add><handShift new="#h3"/> Fulton street eating houses.&#8212;A good looking, democratic, young <subst><del rend="overstrike" seq="1" hand="#h1">fellow,</del> <add rend="unmarked" place="supralinear" seq="2"><handShift new="#h1"/>American,</add></subst><handShift new="#h3"/> <del rend="overstrike">with</del> in his shirt sleeves, was rather peremptorily accosted by our Swiss friend, as "Waiter."&#8212;The young chap's face turned as red as fire, and he was ready for a scrimmage in a moment.&#8212;</p>

            <p>Around the doors of the larger intelligence offices, <del rend="overstrike" hand="#h2"><add rend="insertion" place="supralinear"><handShift new="#h1"/>&#8212;which are <add rend="unmarked" place="supralinear"><handShift new="#h2"/>a</add><handShift new="#h1"/> sort of tangible "want" advertisement&#8212;</add></del><handShift new="#h3"/> stand and lounge the lads and men who <subst><del rend="overstrike" seq="1" hand="#h1">want</del> <add rend="unmarked" place="supralinear" seq="2"><handShift new="#h1"/>wish</add></subst><handShift new="#h3"/> work.&#8212;They are Irish and English, mostly.&#8212;Every <subst><add rend="lasso" place="supralinear" seq="2">well dressed passer,</add> <del rend="overstrike" seq="1">one</del></subst> who comes along, is examined by their

                eyes, with an anxious, appealing sort of look.&#8212;The English have ruddy healthy faces, and their square shoulders and large arms look the right sort for labor.&#8212;We should think these chaps invaluable upon well conducted farms. They are evidently intelligent, and of a sort who would take pride in doing their work well.&#8212;</p>

            <p>The Irish boys are ready for anything&#8212;but mostly prefer, what indeed they are at first <subst><del rend="overstrike" seq="1" hand="#h1">most</del> <add rend="unmarked" place="supralinear" seq="2"><handShift new="#h1"/>best</add></subst><handShift new="#h3"/> fitted for, to wield the pickaxe or the spade.&#8212;They will generally <subst><del rend="overstrike" seq="1" hand="#h1">give</del> <add rend="unmarked" place="supralinear" seq="2"><handShift new="#h1"/>make</add></subst><handShift new="#h3"/> a florid description of their capacities, by no means doing injustice to themselves, and winding up with a strong appeal to your personal benevolence, and the special virtue of giving them the preference.&#8212;</p>

            <p>The Englishman, on the contrary, is a man of few words, and rarely claims more than he deserves.&#8212;Nor does he press himself upon you.&#8212;</p>

            <p>Now and then, should you be looking <del rend="overstrike">after</del> at the scenes in one of these offices, you will see a mistress come after a servant.&#8212;Perhaps she is the keeper of a boarding house&#8212;a place, <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear">by the by</add> where the servants <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear">are apt to</add> get plenty of hard work and rough usage.&#8212;Her col<unclear reason="cut away" cert="medium" resp="#jc">d</unclear> eye ranges over the whole crow<unclear reason="cut away" cert="high" resp="#jc">d</unclear> <gap reason="cut away" unit="chars" atLeast="1"/> at once rejects all the good-l<unclear reason="cut away" cert="medium" resp="#jc">ooking</unclear>

            <p>The good lady inquires and examines, and ponders and looks sharp.&#8212;She thinks well of this one's broad shoulders, but fears that she may be a trifle too fond of whiskey: isn't that the inference from her face?&#8212;In the mean time, the poor girls are quite in a state of excitement and emulation;&#8212;<subst><del rend="overstrike" seq="1">and</del> <add rend="unmarked" place="supralinear" seq="2">until</add></subst> the successful competitor marches off <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear"><handShift new="#h1"/>with her new mistress</add><!-- the text of the insertion is written in faded black ink, but the caret symbol is written in pencil. --><handShift new="#h3"/> as proud as a peacock.&#8212;</p>

            <p>All these girls, likely, have some friend&#8212;some cousin, <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear"><handShift new="#h2"/>aunt,</add><handShift new="#h3"/> or one "whose mother lived near, in the o<del rend="overstrike" hand="#h2">u</del>ld country"&#8212;in whose domicile they are furnished with a shelter, while waiting to get a place.&#8212;The kindness of the Irish to each other, of which this is one specimen, puts to the</p>
