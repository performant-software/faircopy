LOOMINGS

</p><p><ref target="#ref_20209">CALL ME ISHMAEL</ref><note xml:id="ref_20209">Ishmael . . . sail about a little and see the watery part of the world: In <ref type='reference' target='https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:104'>Bible. Genesis</ref> Genesis 16 and 21, <ref type='reference' target='https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:214'>Ishmael</ref> is the son of Abraham and his servant Hagar; but when Abraham's wife, Sarah, gives birth to Isaac in her old age, he casts out Ishmael and Hagar. In Melville's day an "Ishmael" was an outcast and wanderer in conflict with others, while in Jewish and Islamic tradition Ismail is the progenitor of the Arabs. Modern writers have played with the novel's famous first line: Ray Bradbury, for example, quotes it in his radio drama Leviathan 99 (1966); Philip Roth's baseball saga, The Great American Novel (1973) begins "Call me Smitty"; an unsettled Native American in Louise Erdrich's Love Medicine (1984) applies the line to himself; and in Democracy (1984), Joan Didion teases with "Call me the author." Melville wandered a good deal himself; he had been a merchant seaman in 1839, sailing from New York to Liverpool and back, and in 1841 he went whaling in the Pacific on the Acushnet, returning in 1844 as a sailor on the U. S. Frigate United States.</note>. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.  It is a way I have of driving off the <ref target="#ref_14293">spleen,</ref><note xml:id="ref_14293">spleen: melancholy or irritation, from the spleen’s supposed fluid or “humour.” </note> and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my <ref target="#ref_14294">hypos</ref><note xml:id="ref_14294">hypos: short for “hypochondria,” or depression.</note> get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for <ref target="#ref_20843">pistol and ball</ref><note xml:id="ref_20843">pistol and ball . . .

With a philosophical flourish <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:215" type="person">Cato</name> throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.

What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the <ref target="#ref_14300">spiles</ref><note xml:id="ref_14300">spiles: foundation posts for piers. </note>; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the <ref target="#ref_14301">bulwarks</ref><note xml:id="ref_14301">bulwarks: pronounced BULarks, a ship’s sides above the deck. </note> of ships from <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:49" type="place">China</name>; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep.

How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?

</p><p>But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange!

Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?

</p><p>Once more. Say, you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.

Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop of water there!

Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of <name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:221" type="person"><ref target="#ref_19344">Narcissus</ref><note xml:id="ref_19344">Narcissus: Modern readers assume that in Greek myth, <ref type='reference' target='https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:221'>Narcissus</ref> after falling in love with his image in a fountain, drowned himself because he could not embrace it. Classical sources, however, generally depict Narcissus either wasting away or killing himself on land—turning into the flower named for him. But Melville was familiar with authors who allude to a watery death, including Plotinus (201–270 C.E.) in the Enneads, and <ref type='reference' target='https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:245'>Shakespeare</ref>  in “The Rape of Lucrece.”</note></name>, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.

</p><p>Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1432234109546-1fpuc10t8t9-136577bfa6d99f7974c4441e9fef8dac%2F000005737_0041.jpeg"/>you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a <ref target="#ref_14372">Commodore</ref><note xml:id="ref_14372">Commodore: then the highest rank in the U.S. Navy. </note>, or a Captain, or a <ref target="#ref_19345"><name ref="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:222" type="person">Cook</name></ref><note xml:id="ref_19345">Cook: The capitalization of “cook” allows Melville to pun on the name of well-known British explorer <ref type='reference' target='https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:222'>Captain James Cook (1728-1779)</ref>.</note>.  I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, <ref target="#ref_14374">schooners</ref><note xml:id="ref_14374">ships, barques, brigs, schooners: common sailing vessels in descending size.</note>, and what not. And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted <ref target="#ref_14375">river horse</ref><note xml:id="ref_14375">river horse: hippopotamus. </note>, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.

Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades, and be content.

</p><p>Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of.

Adam and Eve as Thieves //
In this paragraph about the difference between “paying and being paid,” the British removed these two amusingly blasphemous sentences referring to Adam and Eve as “orchard thieves,” who, because they disobeyed God by eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, were punished by, among other things, having to sweat for a living.</note></hi> The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that <ref target="#ref_27145">on no account can a monied man enter heaven</ref><note xml:id="ref_27145">the root of all earthly ills . . . monied man enter heaven: A conflation of New Testament passages: “For the love of money is the root of all evil” (1 Timothy: 6.10) and “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God” (Matthew 19.24, Mark 10.25; and almost verbatim in Luke 18.25).</note>. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!

</p><p>Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the <ref target="#ref_19348">Pythagorean maxim</ref><note xml:id="ref_19348">Pythagorean maxim: sixth century BCE philosopher <ref type='reference' target='https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/person:224'>Pythagoras</ref> advised against eating beans to avoid flatulence (or “winds from astern”).</note>), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But <pb facs="https://dave-uploads-juxtaeditions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1432432436195-llbb9mtrblr-0311335cf8affc812317c9ee0c9d0a29%2F000005737_0043.jpeg"/>wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. <ref target="#ref_27142"><hi rend="bold">And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago.

Providence and Politics on Stage // 
Melville’s British editor cut two sentences and revised a third, effectively ruining Ishmael’s joke in which God places him on stage sandwiched between two great political events of the day. Previous to these three sentences, Ishmael states that only the “invisible police officer of the Fates” can account for his decision to go whaling. However, in getting to his joke, he shifts, in the next two sentences, to a stage metaphor, comparing God’s will to “the grand programme of Providence” and Ishmael’s whaling voyage to just an “interlude and solo.” Perhaps the Fates of Greek mythology can be treated lightly, but not so Christianity's God; the blasphemous joke had to be changed. But in expurgating both sentences, the British editor also had to revise the next sentence because its reference to “the bill” (i.e., the playbill for the “programme”) would no longer make sense. Thus, words were added to refer the reader back to “the Fates,” earlier in the passage. In the British edition, then, Melville’s mildly blasphemous joke is gone and his original sentence—“I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:”—instead reads “I take it that this part of the bill of those three mysterious ladies must have run something like this:”. Here, the playbill is confusingly linked to “the Fates,” or, more specifically in the revision, to the three old women who spin, measure, and cut the thread of a person’s life.</note>

</p><p>Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity.
