	<body><p><pb/>CHAPTER 2 THE CARPET-BAG</p><p>I STUFFED a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for <name type="place"><ref>Cape some more stiuff Hor    n      </ref><note xml:id="ref_15362">Cape Horn: southern tip of South America.  <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:60">Cape Horn</ref> </note></name> and the <name type="place">Pacific</name>. Quitting the good <name type="place">city of old Manhatto</name>, I duly arrived in <ref>New Bedford</ref><note xml:id="ref_15376">New Bedford: Located on the Acushnet River in Massachusetts and founded by Nantucket Quakers in the whaling trade, New Bedford was the world’s foremost whaling port in the early 19th century. <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:61">New Bedford, Massachusetts</ref></note>. It was on a Saturday night in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little <ref>packet</ref><note xml:id="ref_15363">packet: mail and passenger vessel making scheduled trips between the same ports.</note> for <ref>Nantucket</ref><note xml:id="ref_19397">Nantucket: The island, twenty-five miles south of Cape Cod, was indeed superseded by New Bedford in the whaling trade. <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:137">Nantucket</ref></note> had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.</p><p>As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing the business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original <pb/>—the <ref>Tyre of this Carthage</ref><note xml:id="ref_15378">Tyre . . . Carthage: Ancient cities on the Mediterranean Sea, now in Syria and Tunisia, respectively. By tradition, Phoenicians from <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:62">Tyre</ref> founded  <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:63">Carthage</ref></note>;—the place where the first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobble-stones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?</p><p>Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious <ref>grapnels</ref><note xml:id="ref_15364">grapnels: small, anchor-like devices for dragging the sea floor; here, his fingers.</note> I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So, wherever you go, <name type="person">Ishmael</name>, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don’t be too particular.</p><p>With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further on, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t you hear? get away from before <pb/>the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.</p><p>Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an <ref>ash-box</ref><note xml:id="ref_15365">ash-box: ashes were kept to spread on icy walkways. </note> in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, <ref>Gomorrah</ref><note xml:id="ref_15379">Gomorrah: In <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/text:104">Bible.

But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then, must needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.</p><p>It seemed the great <ref>Black Parliament</ref><note xml:id="ref_15380">Black Parliament: In 1320, the so-called Black Parliament gathered in judgment on conspirators against Scotland’s King Robert I.</note> sitting in <ref>Tophet</ref><note xml:id="ref_15366">Tophet: hell. </note>. A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a <ref>negro church</ref><note xml:id="ref_21260">a negro church . . . the blackness of darkness: Jude 13, also qtd. by Carlyle in Sartor Resartus (Book 2, Ch. 4), refers to the blackness of darkness.

Douglass sometimes preached at a small negro church that might be the model for the church into which Ishmael stumbles. See Wallace, Douglass and Melville, 20.</note>; and the preacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of “The Trap!”</p><p>Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath—“The Spouter-Inn:—Peter Coffin.”</p><p>Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked <pb/>quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some <ref>burnt district</ref><note xml:id="ref_15382">burnt district: Common expression for any urban area destroyed by fire, but also refers to western New York State’s “burned-over district,” scene of heated revivalism in the 1830s.</note>, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of <ref>pea coffee</ref><note xml:id="ref_15367">pea coffee: made from roasted green peas or chickpeas.</note>.</p><p>It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind <ref>Euroclydon</ref><note xml:id="ref_15368">Euroclydon: the wind that wrecked St. Paul’s ship in Acts 27.</note> kept up a worse howling than ever it did about <ref>poor </ref><name type="person"><ref>Paul</ref></name><ref>’s</ref><note xml:id="ref_27151">REVISION NARRATIVE:

Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which <ref>the wight Death is the only glazier</ref><note xml:id="ref_15369">wight . . . glazier: wight means any person; a glazier installs window glass; the quotation is Ishmael’s invention.</note>.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind—old <ref>black-letter</ref><note xml:id="ref_15370">black-letter: old book printed in a heavy typeface resembling hand-written manuscript. </note>, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the <ref>copestone</ref><note xml:id="ref_15371">copestone: stone placed at the top of a wall or other structure; compare Ch. 32, last paragraph.</note> is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor <name type="artwork">Lazarus</name> there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old <name type="person">Dives</name>, in his red silken wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) <ref>pooh, pooh</ref><note xml:id="ref_27150">Revision Narrative:
Lazarus and Dives //
Melville's British editor expurgated this passage in bold and the chapter's three concluding paragraphs.
In Luke 16:19–23, the homeless and sore-ridden Lazarus lies at the gates of a scornful rich man (elsewhere called Dives) begging for crumbs. When both die, Lazarus goes to heaven, and Dives burns in hell, begging Lazarus to send him water. In this passage, Ishmael elaborates on the inequality of rich and poor by comparing the differences we feel between a tight window that keeps the warmth inside and a sashless or ill-framed window that lets the frost come through. He then compares this difference to the living Lazarus and Dives, the one chattering out in the cold, the other enjoying “a fine frosty night” from inside his summery room. But Melville’s religiously and politically sensitive British editor expurgated all reference to the parable, found in the passages in boldface. The  excision of the last three paragraphs inadvertently reassigns Dives’s jolly words (“What a fine frosty night . . . making my own summer with my own coals”) to Ishmael, thus making Ishmael conclude his previously compassionate reflections by incongruously voicing Dives’s privileged point of view.</note>! What a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.</p><p><pb/>But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in <ref>Sumatra</ref><note xml:id="ref_21261">Sumatra: island in the Indian Ocean, now part of Indonesia.<ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:343">Sumatra, Indonesia</ref>

Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?</p><p>Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the <ref>Moluccas</ref><note xml:id="ref_21262">Sumatra: island in the Indian Ocean, now part of Indonesia.<ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:343">Sumatra, Indonesia</ref>
The Moluccas, or <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:68">Maluku Islands, Indonesia</ref> are also in Indonesia.</note>. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a <ref>Czar</ref><note xml:id="ref_21263">Czar in an ice palace: Building an ice palace was an annual event in <ref type="reference" target="https://mel-catalog.herokuapp.com/api/entries/place:501">St. Petersburg, Russia</ref>St. Petersburg.</note> in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a <ref>temperance society</ref><note xml:id="ref_21264">temperance society: organization promoting complete abstinence from alcohol.</note>, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.</p><p>But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is plenty of that yet to come.
